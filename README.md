# High-Performance-Systems
This repo contains work developed in the High Performance Systems course of my master's at University of Aveiro.

# VHDL
Yap. Here we go again... about to have some more fun with that one hardware description language that causes my soul to leave my body.
We did a parallel encoder and decoder of a [8,4,4] Hadammard code.
# CUDA
Again... Check my CLE repo for some cool CUDA gauss-jordan elimination determinant calculation! 
This time the objective is to optimize the launching configuration of the matrix ordering kernel!
